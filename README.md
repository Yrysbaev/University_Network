# University Network

This project involves designing and implementing a Local Area Network (LAN) for a university to enhance communication among various departments by facilitating data exchange. It was developed as part of the Computer Networks course at North American University.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to upgrade the existing network infrastructure to increase capacity, flexibility, and security. The network topology is designed using Cisco Packet Tracer, focusing on IP-based switches and advanced routing protocols to improve performance and scalability.

### Features

- **IP-based Switching:** Utilizes Cisco Catalyst and Aironet switches for robust and scalable network architecture.
- **Advanced Routing Protocols:** Incorporates RIP for dynamic routing to ensure optimal data paths.
- **Security Enhancements:** Implements Cisco firewalls and VPN configurations to secure network communications.
- **High Availability:** Designs a fail-safe network infrastructure to support critical university operations.

## Installation and Setup

To run the network simulation:
1. Download and install [Cisco Packet Tracer](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer).
2. Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/Yrysbeav/University_Network.git
3. Open the project file with Cisco Packet Tracer.
4. Run the simulation to test different network configurations.

## Network Components

- **Cisco Catalyst 6509 Switches**
- **Cisco Aironet 1140 Access Points**
- **Cisco Unified Computing System (UCS)**

For more details on the network devices and configurations used, see the `Network Devices` section in the project documentation.
